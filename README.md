# week1_project_build_website

The first weekâ€™s project was a good challenge and I feel I have achieved the basic requirements/ user stories of the project.

I struggled a little with margin and padding and I had to play around with it to find the correct spacing for elements on the page. I also had to play around with the positioning as some elements were hidden or in the wrong place e.g. I needed to put position relative on the parent element of the sections and then position absolute child elements.

I found W3Schools helpful as an aid when I encountered problems as it's easy to navigate with short simple answers and examples.
