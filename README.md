# week1_project_build_website

The first weekâ€™s project was a good challenge and I feel I have achieved the basic requirements/ user stories of the project.

I struggled a little with margin and padding and I had to play around with it to find the correct spacing for elements on the page. I also had to play around with the positioning as some elements were hidden or in the wrong place e.g. all my .bottom-containers (which were set to positon absolute) were sitting on top of each other in the first section but to resolve that I needed to add position relative on the parent element. I think I also need to revisit my notes on flex box as that can also be confusing when building a webpage.

I found W3Schools helpful as an aid when I encountered problems as it's easy to navigate with short simple answers and examples.
